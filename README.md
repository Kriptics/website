# Zenel Shopify Theme

This repository contains the Zenel Shopify theme inspired by the energy of Ulta Beauty and a holistic health destination. It includes homepage sections, collection and product templates, and a dedicated Health Hub page for wellness content.

## Theme Highlights
- Immersive hero, category showcase, and wellness storytelling sections
- Bundles &amp; sets highlights featuring Relax &amp; Restore, Radiance Kit, Posture Reset Pack, and Daily Wellness Starter
- Product and collection templates with ritual-focused messaging
- Health Hub landing page with content modules for guides, playlists, and community features

## Getting Started
1. Compress the theme files into a `.zip` archive (Shopify requires a zipped theme upload). The repository ignores generated archives, so create the package locally with the command below whenever you need an updated upload.
2. Upload the resulting zip file to your Shopify admin via **Online Store → Themes → Add theme → Upload zip file**.

### Create the Theme Zip
```
zip -r zenel-shopify-theme.zip assets config layout sections templates
```

The archive will include all required theme directories. If you add new files or directories, rerun the command to update the package.
